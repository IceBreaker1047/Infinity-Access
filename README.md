Welcome to Infinity Access, a modern and dynamic project designed to demonstrate advanced web development techniques using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Infinity Access is a fully responsive web-based application designed to showcase:

A dynamic and interactive slider for seamless user experience.
Navigation options for users to interact with the interface directly or through auto-slide functionality.
A modern design approach to highlight the potential of JavaScript-based UI components.
This project was built as part of my learning journey and demonstrates my skills in frontend development.
